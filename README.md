The Google+ Ruby Quickstart lets you get started with the Google+ platform
in a few minutes.

## The app demonstrates:

 * Using the Google+ Sign-In button to get an OAuth 2.0 refresh token.
 * Exchanging the refresh token for an access token.
 * Making Google+ API requests with the access token, including getting a
   list of people that the user has circled.
 * Disconnecting the app from the user's Google account and revoking tokens.
